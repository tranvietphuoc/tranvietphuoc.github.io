# This is my personal blog
* I create a tool to render from markdown file to static site by `Python` for my self.
* To use this template, you need to clone the repo first.
* Then write the your posts in `.md` format, edit the metadata and push them into `prototypes` folder. Notice that, the metadata of .md file you need to keep track of the format
```
title: ....
date: ....
tags: ....
name: ....
summary: ....
```
* Finnally. Run `./render` to render `html` files. All `html` files of posts will go to `posts` folder.
* To publish your blog. Read [this guide](https://pages.github.com/)
* In addition, you can add a comment plugin your self call [utterances](https://utteranc.es/?installation_id=19767855&setup_action=install)
