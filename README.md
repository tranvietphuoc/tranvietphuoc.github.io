# This is my personal blog
* I create a tool to render from markdown file to static site by `Python` for my self.
* To use this template, you need to clone the repo first.
* Then write the your posts in `.md` format, edit the metadata and push them into `prototypes` folder.
* Finnally. Run `./run.sh` to render `html` files. All `html` files of posts will go to `posts` folder.
* To publish your blog. Read [this guide](https://pages.github.com/)
